# SubjectBrowse (DEFUNCT: See [Reference](https://github.com/Daniel-KM/Reference) for current work)

SubjectBrowse was an Omeka 1.x plugin for providing browse access to resources by subject heading.  It is no longer in development.  

A successor project exists [here](https://github.com/Daniel-KM/Reference), all inquiries, development effort, and accolades should be directed there.
